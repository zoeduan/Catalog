# Tag Grouping Process

## What Are Tag Groups?

Tags on GitHub repos (topics) and Hugging Face repos (card metadata) are free-form text, so
the same concept often appears under multiple spellings: `computer-vision`, `computer vision`,
`cv`. Tag groups normalize this noise so the catalog filter dropdown shows one clean canonical
tag instead of a dozen near-duplicates.

Tag groups live in **`public/tag-groups.js`** as a plain JavaScript object:

```js
const TAG_GROUPS = {
    "canonical tag": ["raw-tag-1", "raw tag 2", "raw_tag_3"],
    ...
};
```

- The **key** (`"canonical tag"`) is the display tag shown in the UI filter dropdown.
- The **value array** lists every raw API tag that should be normalized to that key.
- Raw tags not present in any array pass through unchanged and appear as-is in the UI.
- Raw tags that contain a colon (e.g. `license:mit`, `format:parquet`) are automatically
  filtered out as Hugging Face system metadata so they never reach the UI. This can be changed in [src/normalizeTag.js](../src/normalizeTag.js), by removing the marked option line.
- Raw tags are maintained and matched-against for keyword searching and do appear in repo cards.

## Initial Setup

When first setting up a catalog from this template you will need to build your custom, `public/tag-groups.js`.
For the weekly scan to be useful, you need to build an
initial set of tag groups from your organization's existing tags.

**Step 1 — Generate the full tag list:**

```console
node scripts/export-tags.js
```

This writes every raw tag currently used across your GitHub and Hugging Face repos to
`scripts/tag-export.txt`. Commit that file to `main`, it becomes the baseline all future
weekly diffs compare against.

**Step 2 — Build the initial `tag-groups.js`:**

With a fresh catalog you'll likely have dozens or hundreds of raw tags to group all at once.
Our experience: feeding the full `tag-export.txt` into an AI assistant (we used Claude's Sonnet 4.6)
produced a solid first draft of canonical groups quickly. However, it needed significant
manual review - the AI tended to miss obvious groupings like singular/plural pairs (`image` and
`images`) and sometimes invented canonical names that didn't match how
the tags were actually used.

Our recommendation: **use AI output as a springboard, not a final answer.** Let it handle the
bulk of the structural work, then go through the result yourself with the raw tag list open
side-by-side. Pay particular attention to:

- Singular/plural variants (`specimen` / `specimens`, `annotation` / `annotations`)
- Hyphenated vs. space-separated forms (`animal-behavior` / `animal behavior`)
- Acronyms and their expansions (`cv` / `computer vision`, `xai` / `explainable ai`)
- Closely related concepts that warrant separate canonical tags vs. one broader group
- Any domain-specific or specialized terms. In our case, this was the Hawaiian birds and plants that Claude did not recognize.

The manual pass by those familiar with the terms provides the most value, but is facilitated by the initial grouping.

## When to Update Tag Groups

A GitHub Actions workflow runs every Monday at 08:00 UTC. It fetches all current raw tags from
the GitHub and Hugging Face APIs, diffs them against the committed baseline in
`scripts/tag-export.txt`, and opens (or updates) a pull request titled
**`[Tag Scan] New tags detected — review tag-groups.js`** whenever 5 or more new tags appear.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Required token**: The weekly tag scan workflow requires a fine-grained access token with **Pull requests: Read and write** permission on the catalog repo. Follow the instructions in [App Authentication](app-authentication.md) to create and install a private Catalog Automation App for token generation.

You should update `public/tag-groups.js` when that PR is opened or updated.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open the Tag Scan PR** — find it in the repo's Pull Requests tab (title starts with
   `[Tag Scan]`). The PR body lists every raw tag that is new relative to `scripts/tag-export.txt`.

2. **Open `public/tag-groups.js`** in an editor.

3. **For each new tag in the list, decide:**

   | Situation | Action |
   |-----------|--------|
   | It's a variant of an existing concept (e.g. `bird-detection` when `object detection` exists) | Add the raw tag to the existing group's array |
   | It represents a new concept that groups with other existing or new tags | Add a new key + array, under the appropriate section comment |
   | It's a Hugging Face system tag (contains a colon, e.g. `license:mit`) | No edit - these are filtered out by the app and will not reach the UI (see [above](#what-are-tag-groups) for how to not filter these out) |
   | It's a one-off with no grouping candidates | No edit - it passes through unchanged and appears as-is in the UI |

4. **Commit the updated `tag-groups.js` to the PR branch** (`tag-scan/auto`).

5. **Merge the PR** once all tags are addressed.

## Running the Export Script Manually

To generate a fresh snapshot of all current raw tags outside of the weekly workflow:

```console
node scripts/export-tags.js
```

Output is written to `scripts/tag-export.txt` (one tag per line, sorted, deduplicated).
This is also the baseline file the weekly workflow diffs against, so if you run the script and
commit the result to `main`, subsequent scans will compare against that new baseline.
